# Osu-replacer
simple console tool that allows you to delete or replace the background of every osu map you have.
most backgrounds use jpg files, make sure you have a jpg first to cover most of the maps you have.
IF YOU RUN DEL ITS OVER, THE PROGRAM DOESNT CHECK THE BEATMAP FILES DIRECTLY, SO IF YOU WANT TO REPLACE MAKE SURE TO USE REP.
