# osu! replacer

A simple console tool that allows you to **delete** the background of every osu! map you have, or **replace** them with another image of the same format.

### Features

- Replace every map background with a single image of the same file type (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`).
- Saves you from public judgment from non-osu players.
