# Osu-replacer
simple console tool that allows you to delete the background of every osu map you have.
it can also replace the background of your osu maps in batch, but said feature should be used carefully, and is not yet on the state i would like it to be
currently replacing backgrounds only works if A:you have an image in the same format as most of your maps and B: you are okay with deleting any background that isnt replaceable
Once deleted, the tool has no way of fixing your backgrounds, this may be fixed on a future update, for now make sure to actually use rep instead of del if you plan to replace
Otherwise just enjoy not having to worry about someone seeing your osu backgrounds in public <:)
